                                 INTRODUCTION
                             --------------------

"Stones of History" is arcade game, a flavor of breakout (also known as 
arcanoid). Main feature is historical appearance. All game levels are grouped 
in epochs. Epoch roughly corresponds to the main epochs of our civilization or 
particular cultural epoch (prehistoric epoch, ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome etc). 
All epochs are sorted in chronological order.

Each level within epoch corresponds to some significant event. For each epoch 
and for each level short history information is displayed. So game can be used 
also for educational purposes.

Several epochs can be opened for playing at the same time (e.g. ancient Greece 
and Rome). Next epochs are opened only after completing all previous epochs. 
That is, if Greece epoch and epoch of Persian Empire are opened, the Epoch of 
Rome can't be opened until they both became finished.

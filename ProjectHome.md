# Development goals #
  1. Lazy resource loading (e.g. loading resources only necessary for current level).
  1. Study collision detection and building real-time game process rather that per-cycle.
  1. Practice level change scheme, previously created. It also includes work with level  tree.
  1. Creating common framework for working with scenes.
